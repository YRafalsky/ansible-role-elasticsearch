elasticsearch
=============

This role will install/un-install and configure Elasticsearch, managing the process with supervisord.  Many settings from the elasticsearch.yml config file have been specifically called out here as they are the most commonly used and may include defaults.  Any additional settings not called out here can be included as a hash to the elasticsearch_conf_additional variable. As Ansible does not allow hash merging, this method is required.
Requirements
------------

Java is required to be installed outside of this role.  Supervisor will be installed via a package by this role.
